# fishing-club-managment-web-app
Web application for managing fishing clubs and their waters.

This web application was started to teach myself ExtJS framework. Its probably a great example of how to use ExtJS 
and the command line tool for it (sencha command). We also have a some good examples for Datasource and MyBatis set-up 
and use with Spring 3.

What may also be of interest is the use of Google maps in this project.

It never quite  made it to production but there is plently of feature in it. A bit of tweeking and it could probably
be deployed.
